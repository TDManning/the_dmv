# The DMV

## Reflections after debugging, Iteration 1, pt.1

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process?**<br />
In order to build out this code base I started by reading the full interaction pattern of each iteration. After getting a through understanding of the interaction pattern I sequentially wrote tests that would ensure that I was showing what my code is going to do. Next I wrote code to pass the tests. In order to confirm what I thought was happening accurately, I tested the interaction pattern in pry to verify my expected output.

2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?**<br /> At first the code looked unfamiliar (becasue it was!) and it took some time to look through the files to understand where I was jumping in. Overall it wasn't particularly hard because I liked the ways it was structured overall. Bugs are to be expected and having another coder to look for bugs can be helpful in trying to fix them. 

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what wouldâ€™ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**<br />Working with an existing code base was overall very wonderful as it gave me template for what the entire project launching off point would be and its basic structure. In order to make the code work correctly I had to fix other coders' "bugs" and that wasn't particularly challenging since they were fairly straightforward fixes. By reading my failed tests fully I had enough information to locate the errors and modify them.
